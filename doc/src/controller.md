# Wireless Controller

Drosix offers the possibility to control the drone with a Bluetooth Controller (tested with Sony PS4  controller).

## Setup the Bluetooth stack on the beaglebone blue

In buildroot, the Bluetooth subsystem should be activated in the Linux kernel (networking support/bluetooth subsystem support).
The system configuration for `/dev` management should be changed to use `udev`.
Finally, the bluez library is required with the sixaxis plug-in and the deprecated tools enabled.

To enable the bluetooth controller on the beaglebone the pin accessible in Â `/sys/class/leds/wl18xx_bt_en` should be turned on (set brightness to 1).
Then, the controller should be attached to the bluetooth stack.
The controller is connected to the UART 3 uses the texas protocol at 300000 bauds.

```
hciattach
/dev/ttyS3 texas 300000
```

Then, the bluetooth deamon can be started.
Note that the executable is not in the path but rather in `/usr/libexec/bluetooth/bluetoothd`.

A custom init script is used to automatically start the bluetooth on boot.
The script should be run after dbus because bluetoothd rely on it.

## Connecting the Sony controller manually

To connect the controller open a shell on drosix and start a new `bluetoothctl` shell.
Then connect the sixaxis to the beaglebone blue through USB.
A message will ask you to authorize a service, type yes.
Your controller is now paired and you can remove the USB cable.
No manipulation will be required for the following boot.

## Connecting the Sony controller automatically

A patch is present in the `beaglebone_blue` buildroot board directory of Drosix.
This patch disable the interactive authorization process used to pair a Sony controller.
Then, a Bluetooth agent has to run in background to automatically pair any controller connected through USB to the beaglebone blue.
The bluetooth agent used by drosix is `bt-agent` from bluez-tools.
It is launched during the Bluetooth start up by the init script.
